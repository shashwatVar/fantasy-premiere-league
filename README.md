<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a simple project on the concept of simulation for playing and enjoying football matches. 

Some Features
* Buy players from a database consisting of over 16000 players.
* Check the different attributes of players before buying them.
* Cool drag and drop feature for the selection of playing 11.
* Morale adjuster of the player on the basis of past performances.
* Matches are decided randomly everyday for matches to be played at 16:24.
* Match server is active for an hour (16 - 17).
* Match is played for just 9 mins till 16:33.


The algorithm for the simulation of matches is based on position specific features.For ex - a Forward will only input his striking ability, his defending won't
be considered. Hence the game is pretty unbiased and relies on conditional probability to produce results.
